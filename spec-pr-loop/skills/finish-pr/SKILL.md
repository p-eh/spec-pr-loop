description: Wrap-up audit for a PR once its review comments have been addressed — checks whether tracked work is actually complete (and archivable, if the project uses OpenSpec), verifies the project's own drift/consistency guards still pass, and mines the full review history for patterns worth turning into a guideline or an automated check. Use when the user says "finish the PR", "wrap this PR up", "is this PR done", "finish pr step", or similar.

Audit pass for closing out a PR: is the tracked work actually done, do the project's own guard checks still pass, and did the review conversation surface a pattern worth codifying. This is an audit and light process-improvement pass, not a place to sneak in unrelated feature work.

## Process

### 1. Unresolved-thread check

Do this first — it's the most direct "is this PR actually done" signal, and it's easy to get wrong by accident: replying to a review comment does **not** mark its GitHub thread resolved, that's a separate action. A thread can be fully addressed (code changed, replied to) and still show as unresolved because nobody explicitly resolved it. The REST `pulls/comments` endpoint doesn't expose resolution status at all, so checking "did I reply to everything" is not the same check — use GraphQL:

```
gh api graphql -f query='query { repository(owner:"<owner>", name:"<repo>") { pullRequest(number:<n>) { reviewThreads(first:100) { nodes { id isResolved comments(first:1) { nodes { databaseId path body } } } } } } }'
```

For each thread where `isResolved` is `false`:
- If it was actually addressed (a `Claude:` reply exists confirming the change/answer, and the change is really in the code) but just never resolved — **do not resolve it yourself.** Resolving a thread is the user's call, not an automated action, even when the work behind it is done. List it in the summary as ready for them to resolve; add a brief closing reply first only if the existing reply doesn't already state the thread is settled.
- If it was never actually addressed — that's a real gap, not a resolution-tracking gap. Go address it (use `pr-comment-triage`) before continuing.

### 2. Completion / archive check

- If the project tracks work as an OpenSpec change (`openspec/changes/<name>/tasks.md`), count checked vs. unchecked tasks for the *whole* change, not just this PR's section.
- All checked → run (or tell the user to run) `openspec-archive-change` to move it to `openspec/changes/archive/` and sync delta specs into `openspec/specs/`.
- Not all checked → report status honestly (e.g. "21/39 done, Sections 5-7 still open") and do **not** archive. A PR finishing its own scope does not mean the whole tracked change is done.
- If the project doesn't use OpenSpec, look for whatever completion artifact it does use (a tracking issue, a checklist in the PR description) and apply the same "don't declare done until everything's actually checked" discipline.

### 3. Guard-check audit

Run the project's own automated consistency checks — linter, test suite, and anything that specifically guards against docs/spec/code drift (an `openspec validate` pre-commit hook, a test that cross-checks documented CLI flags against the real parser, etc.). If none of these drift-guards exist yet and this PR touched a public interface (CLI flags, config keys, API shape) that got documented somewhere, consider adding a cheap one now — see the "flag-consistency test" pattern: introspect the real interface, grep docs for mentions of it, assert they match. Don't build something elaborate; a targeted test that would have caught the specific drift this PR already had to fix by hand is the right scope.

### 4. Mine the review history

Pull the **entire** review comment history for the PR (all rounds, not just the latest), including both inline comments and any general/issue-level comments:

```
gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<n>/comments --paginate
gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<n>/comments --paginate
```

Group by underlying theme (not literal wording — "comment too verbose" and "shorten this comment" and "too much prose" are the same theme). For each theme:

- **1-2 occurrences**: a one-off. Not worth process change; skip, or note it only if it's genuinely surprising.
- **3+ occurrences of the same category**: this is a pattern, not a one-off mistake. Don't just write it down again — build an automated check for it if one is feasible (a pre-commit hook, a lint rule, a test), the same way a repeated "docs drifted from code" complaint became a consistency test. Verify the check actually catches the violation (reintroduce it deliberately, confirm the check fails, revert) before considering it done. If genuinely not automatable (a judgment call, not a mechanical pattern), add it as an explicit guideline in the project's instructions file (CLAUDE.md or equivalent) instead — but automation beats documentation whenever the pattern is checkable.
- Also watch for meta-patterns even without 3+ recurrences: e.g. "check for an existing tracked idea before creating a new one" if that mistake (or near-miss) shows up even once alongside evidence it could easily recur.

### 5. Summarize

Short report: thread-resolution status (how many unresolved, how many done-but-unresolved and ready for the user to close, how many still need real work), completion status (and whether anything got archived), what guard checks ran and their result, what got automated vs. documented from the review-history scan (with commit references), and anything explicitly left as-is with a one-line reason.

## Guardrails

- Never archive a change with unchecked tasks, even if this PR's own scope is fully done.
- **Never resolve a review thread.** Report which ones look ready and let the user resolve them — that action is theirs, always, even when the underlying work is unambiguously complete.
- Don't invent a new hook/guideline from a single comment — require actual recurrence, or a clear meta-pattern, before adding process weight. Noise in, noise out.
- Don't use this pass to start unrelated implementation work the review never asked for — if something looks worth doing but is out of scope, note it (a stub, a follow-up) rather than doing it here.
- Confirm before anything destructive or merge-adjacent (archiving is a move+sync, not destructive, but a `git merge`/`gh pr merge` is — never do that as part of this skill without the user explicitly asking).
